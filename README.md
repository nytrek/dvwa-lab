# DVWA Lab

Writeups from working through [Damn Vulnerable Web Application](https://github.com/digininja/DVWA)
in a local lab. Each writeup covers one vulnerability across DVWA's security
levels, with the root cause in the source, how I exploited it, and how the
higher levels fix it.

I keep these to document what I actually did and to have something to point
back to. Notes are written for someone who already knows the basics.

## Legal

Everything here targets a copy of DVWA running on my own machine. DVWA is built
to be attacked for training. Do not run any of this against systems you don't
own or don't have written permission to test.

## Lab

How the lab is set up (Docker, versions, how to reach it): [00-setup](00-setup/).

## Writeups

| # | Module | Levels | Status |
|---|--------|--------|--------|
| 01 | [Brute Force](writeups/01-brute-force/) | low | done |
| 02 | Command Injection | - | planned |
| 03 | SQL Injection | - | planned |
| 04 | File Upload | - | planned |

More modules and higher levels as I get to them.
